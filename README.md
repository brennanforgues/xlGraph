MATLAB function to display data in MS Excel table

For relatively simple 2D charts, I always felt excel did a better job than the MATLAB "plot" function. So I wrote a function to plot excel charts within a MATLAB script   

The function can plot up to 5 curves on the same graph 

NOTE: functions must be saved in your MATLAB "current folder"
